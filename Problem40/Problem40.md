# Champernowne's constant
### Problem 40

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

0.12345678910<font color=red>1</font>112131415161718192021...

It can be seen that the 12<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part is 1.

If dn represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

d<sub>1</sub> × d<sub>10</sub> × d<sub>100</sub> × d<sub>1000</sub> × d<sub>10000</sub> × d<sub>100000</sub> × d<sub>1000000</sub>
