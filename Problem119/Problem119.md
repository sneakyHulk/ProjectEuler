# Digit power sum
### Problem 119

The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8<sup>3</sup> = 512.
Another example of a number with this property is 614656 = 284<sup>4</sup>.

We shall define a<sub>n</sub> to be the nth term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that a<sub>2</sub> = 512 and a<sub>10</sub> = 614656.

Find a<sub>30</sub>.
