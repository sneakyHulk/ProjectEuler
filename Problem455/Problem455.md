# Powers With Trailing Digits
### Problem 455

Let f(n) be the largest positive integer x less than 109 such that the last 9 digits of nx form the number x (including leading zeros), or zero if no such integer exists.

For example:

f(4) = 411728896 (4411728896 = ...490<ins>411728896</ins>)\
f(10) = 0\
f(157) = 743757 (157743757 = ...567<ins>000743757</ins>)

Σ f(n), 2 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>3</sup> = 442530011399

Find Σ f(n), 2 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>.
