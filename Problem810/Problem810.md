# XOR-Primes
### Problem 810

We use for the bitwise XOR of and

.

Define the XOR-product of
and , denoted by , similar to a long multiplication in base

, except that the intermediate results are XORed instead of the usual integer addition.

For example,
, or in base ,

:

An XOR-prime is an integer
greater than that is not an XOR-product of two integers greater than . The above example shows that is not an XOR-prime. Similarly, is not an XOR-prime. The first few XOR-primes are and the 10th XOR-prime is

.

Find the
th XOR-prime.
