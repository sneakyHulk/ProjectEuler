# Number spiral diagonals
### Problem 28

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<font color=red>21</font> 22 23 24 <font color=red>25</font>\
20 &nbsp; <font color=red>7</font> &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; <font color=red>9</font> 10\
19 &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; <font color=red>1</font> &nbsp; 2 11\
18 &nbsp; <font color=red>5</font> &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; <font color=red>3</font> 12\
<font color=red>17</font> 16 15 14 <font color=red>13</font>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
