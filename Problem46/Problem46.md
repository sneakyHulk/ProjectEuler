# Goldbach's Other Conjecture
### Problem 46

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2 &#183; 1<sup>2</sup>\
15 = 7 + 2 &#183; 2<sup>2</sup>\
21 = 3 + 2 &#183; 3<sup>2</sup>\
25 = 7 + 2 &#183; 3<sup>2</sup>\
27 = 19 + 2 &#183; 2<sup>2</sup>\
33 = 31 + 2 &#183; 1<sup>2</sup>

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
