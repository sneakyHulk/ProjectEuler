# Multiples with small digits
### Problem 303

For a positive integer n, define f(n) as the least positive multiple of n that, written in base 10, uses only digits ≤ 2.

Thus f(2)=2, f(3)=12, f(7)=21, f(42)=210, f(89)=1121222.

Also, Σ<sup>100</sup><sub>n=1</sub> f(n) / n = 11363107.\
Find Σ<sup>100000</sup><sub>n=1</sub> f(n) / n.
